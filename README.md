<p>This is a lab that was assigned to me in my  Senior C++ class. It is to show if we were capable of using I/O Methods, input valdiation and class / struc methods</p>
<h1> What is it? </h1>
<p>It is a library system that is built in the C++ compiler terminal window and it will export and import user inputs into text files.</p>
